/*************************************************************************
 This sample targets DataWarehouse workload. We recommend using clustered 
 columnstore index for large tables (million+) rows and traditional rowstore
 for tables of size < 1 million rows. The examples here are based on star schema
 consisting of FACT and DIMENSION tables.The examples hi-light the both the 
 storage savings and performance enhancements available in Azure SQL DB

 We have two fact tables FactResellerSalesXL_CCI and FactResellerSalesXL_PageCompressed.
 They are identical except one table is based on clustered columnstore index
 and other table is regular rowstore table with PAGE compression

 Note: A Pre-requisite is following the instructions in the document: AzureSQLDB_ColumnstoreSetup.docx
